# LangChain JS Tutorial

I'm happy to share that I’ve created a beginner-friendly tutorial for working with **LangChain JS** and **Google Gemini**.

This tutorial is designed to explain the **core concepts of LangChain** in **five separate sections**, each with its own **dedicated GitHub branch**:

1. **Prompt** – How to build reusable AI prompts
2. **LLM** – Understanding and using Large Language Models
3. **LLM Model** – Using Gemini Flash 1.5 with LangChain
4. **Memory** – Storing and managing conversation context
5. **Read Content (PDF)** – Reading files and asking AI questions based on their content

Each section is separated into its own branch to make learning easier and more focused.

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework that helps you build AI apps using tools like:

* Prompts
* Memory
* File readers
* LLMs like Gemini, GPT, Claude, etc.

It lets you combine all of these into powerful and flexible AI workflows.

## What is an LLM?

LLM stands for **Large Language Model** — a type of AI trained on a large set of text data to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs can do things like answering questions, summarizing text, writing code, and more.

## What is an LLM Model?

An **LLM model** is a specific version or type of LLM. In this tutorial, I used:


This is Google’s Gemini Flash 1.5, a fast and efficient model suitable for real-time responses and simple AI tasks.

## Covered Tutorial Topics

Each branch in the repository contains a complete, isolated example:

* **Prompt**: Dynamic prompt creation with variables
* **LLM**: Interacting with Gemini via LangChain
* **LLM Model**: Configuring Gemini Flash 1.5 for use in JS
* **Memory**: Tracking previous messages in a conversation
* **PDF Content**: Reading PDF files and answering questions about them

All examples are written in JavaScript using modern LangChain features.

## GitHub Repository

 [Github code](https://github.com/NasirSultan/LangChain-Tutorial-JS)

Each concept is organized in its own branch for easier understanding.

## What's Next?

In the future, I plan to build a complete **LangChain + Gemini project** that combines all five of these concepts:

* Dynamic prompt input
* LLM configuration
* Memory and history
* PDF or web content retrieval
* Intelligent chat with full context

This project will help demonstrate how everything works together in one real-world AI assistant.
